# Steam-Locomotive
The project aims to make a 3D model of a steam locomotive using Autodesk Inventor. A steam locomotive is a rail
vehicle that uses the expansion of steam to create the force to move itself and other
vehicles. It can be considered as a steam engine on wheels. Combustible
substances such as coal, oil, and wood are burnt in locomotive boilers to fuel it. Usually, coal is used due to its
easy accessibility and cheap price.
